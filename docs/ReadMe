I have decided that instead of parsing HL7 into generic HL7 Objects, I would parse them into the real events/objects that they represent. For example, the PID segment is parsed into a patient(pt) object. This will make storing, editing, querying the data easier. 

I will create generic functions for parsing data types, but each segment in a feild will be parsed with what each parsed into an appropriately named key for the object.
